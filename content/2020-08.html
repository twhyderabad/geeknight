    title: "Your Dashboard sucks, how to fix it?"
    subtitle: "Take a look at your desk. Now take a look at the wall. Now take a look at your hallway. If you're working in IT delivery or infrastructure chances are your eyes have at least met one dashboard, if not more, while your gaze was wondering.</br> How often do you actually look at said dashboard(s)? How much of the information it presents is tailored towards you? Is the dashboard actually helpful .. is it .. valuable .. to you? </br> The way the human mind captures, processes and interprets information is different for everyone, however, the results for our dashboards are supposed to be the same: an informed human at the helm of their digital garden of products. The way we design dashboards though is largely different, an information overload, cramming as much information into them \"because we might need them some day\" and not because we actually need them. Therefore, we forego the one advantage dashboards have over other traditional methods of information capture: Immediacy and relevancy. And that sucks. Let me introduce you to a couple of examples and a few ways out of the information jungle. For better, well-informed decision making at a moment's notice!"
